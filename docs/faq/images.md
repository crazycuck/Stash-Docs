## WebP images are not working in Safari

Performer images uploaded in WebP format will not display on versions of Safari prior to version 13 or on anything earlier than MacOS Big Sur. This is a [limitation of Safari](https://caniuse.com/webp){:target="_blank"}. As a workaround, ensure you are uploading performer images in .jpg or .png format.
