## How can I move my library from one location to another?

1. Go to :fontawesome-solid-gear: **Settings** > **Library**.
1. Under Library heading find the old library path. Click :fontawesome-solid-ellipsis-vertical: > **Delete**.
1. Now add your new library path. Click on **Add Directory**.
1. Select the directory you want to add and click **Confirm**.
1. Go to :fontawesome-solid-gear: **Settings** > **Tasks**.
1. Under Library heading click **Scan** to start the task. 

This will update all the paths for the existing objects without having to re-generate supported files.
