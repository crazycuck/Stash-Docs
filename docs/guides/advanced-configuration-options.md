Some configuration options can not be edited through the UI and should only be used if needed.

Depending on the option they can be configured either by editing the `config.yml` configuration file or by using an enviroment variable or in a few cases by using flags when running stash.

As an example the `port` option can be changed from the default `9999` to `1234`  by one of the below methods:

- adding `port: 1234` to the config.yml file
- setting the ENV variable **STASH_PORT** to **1234** eg `STASH_PORT=1234 ./stash`
- using the flag **--port** when running stash  `./stash --port 1234`
