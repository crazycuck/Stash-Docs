There are several ways to get metadata into Stash.

You can configure your metadata sources under :fontawesome-solid-gear: **Settings** > **Metadata Providers**. See sections below for more details. 

- [stash-box instances](/metadata-sources/stash-box-instances) - more automatic, crowdsourced metadata
- [Scrapers](/metadata-sources/scrapers) - more individual, can be used for different databases, official studios
