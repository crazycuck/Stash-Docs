??? tip "stash-git-index"
    Exhaustive list of git repositories related to Stash [Google Sheets document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yudaRDo_3ZOVivviffvQiSGU_gNpgkG4kIYrJP6DHP4/edit?usp=sharing).

??? tip "Utility no longer works"
    If you found that utility is no longer working you can try contacting the author directly or create an issue on their Git platform. You can also create a GitHub issue on [Stash-Docs](https://github.com/stashapp/Stash-Docs){target=_blank} for it to be removed from the list.

### [clip-mash](https://github.com/soundchaser128/clip-mash){target=_blank}

=== "Description"

    Video editing app that allows you to automate creating compilations from multiple videos. It runs in your browser. It's mostly made for, ahem, adult content, which is why it can connect to Stash and fetch videos and scene markers from there to guide the video creation process. You can also use local files and set the markers in ClipMash itself and then generate a compilation based on that.
